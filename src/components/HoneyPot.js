We sppun up an EC2 instance purposeply allowing all traffic, all malicious threat actors, all hacktivists and nation states, to come for us aka a honey pot. Normally we try to prevent these characters for assesing our machines, but for malware analysis, this is exactly the strategy we went to implement. With our vulnerable machine deployed, we captured traffic for a set amount of time (or like me, if you forget to turn off your instance 72hours), and we also deployed our machine in a specific region. I decided to deploy in northern california despite the pull to deploy the machine somewhere more interesting such as hong kong or singapore. In the end, the reasoning that 'everyone' wants a piece of the USA won out."
